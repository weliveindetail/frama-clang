This is the user manual for the \framac plug-in
\fclang\footnote{\url{https://frama-c.com/frama-clang.html}}. The contents of this
document correspond to version \fclangversion of the plug-in compatible with the
\fcversion version of \framac~\cite{userman,fac15}.  The development of
the \fclang plug-in is still ongoing.  Features described by this document will certainly
evolve in the future.

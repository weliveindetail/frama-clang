This is the user manual for the \framac plug-in
\fclang\footnote{\url{https://frama-c.com/frama-clang.html}}. The contents of this
document correspond to version \fclangversion of the plug-in compatible with the
\fcversion version of \framac~\cite{userman,fac15}.  The development of
the \fclang plug-in is still ongoing.  Features described by this document will certainly
evolve in the future.

\section*{TODO}

These items are not yet addressed
\begin{itemize}
\item (Introduction) Verify the version of Clang supported
\item The custom build instructions with a prefix to a temp directory fail
\item Sort out the interactions among the options -verbose -debug -quiet -fclang-debug -fclang-verbose -fclang-msg-key -fclang-warn-key
\item Sort out and describe interactions among -annot -pp-annot and frama-clang
\item frama-clang info/warn/error messages are not yet properly categorized and integrated with -fclang-log, -fclang-msg-key, fclang-warn-key. In particular, clang messages are completely independent
\item Add comments about using system header files
\item Remove \$FRAMAC\_SHARE from the default command-line, and builtin.h from \$FRAMAC\_SHARE
\item Comment on the demangling options
\item Comment on printing out the preprocessed file
\item \irg options are not included in -fclang-h
\item -print option to \irg
\item Review the clang and \irg options
\item Fix how to do custom ASTs
\item decribe the framaCIRGen options: -x -b -v --gen-impl-meth
\item Comment on handling of unicode in the preprocessor
\item Review the preprocessor tokens
\end{itemize}

Bugs
\begin{itemize}
\item framaCIRGen -help expects an argument
\item non-clang options not included in framaCIRGen -help
\item The -o option is required
\item What is the -w option
\item framaCIRGen -o prints help summary twice
\item it appears that trigraph processing cannot be turned off, is on by default for framaCIRGen but off by default for clang++; not sure why
\item it does not seem that clang options are passed through, e.g. -fdollars-in-identifiers; framaCIRGen defaults are different than clang
\item preprocessor does not concatenate string literals
\end{itemize}

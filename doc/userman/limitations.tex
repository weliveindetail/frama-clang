\chapter{Known Limitations}

The development of the \fclang plug-in is still ongoing.
\fclang does not implement all of current C++ nor all of 
\acslpp as defined in its language definition.\cite{acslpp}
The mosty important such limitations are described in this section.

\section{Implementation of C++}

The following are not implemented in \acslpp.
\begin{itemize}
\item \acslpp definitions within template declarations
\item digraphs within \acslpp annotations
\item preprocessing is restricted within \acslpp annotations (cf. \S\ref{sec:preprocessing})
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation of \acslpp}

\begin{itemize}

\item ghost declarations
\item model declarations
\item set comprehensions
\end{itemize}

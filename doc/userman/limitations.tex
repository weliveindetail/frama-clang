\chapter{Known Limitations}

The development of the \fclang plug-in is still ongoing.
\fclang does not implement all of current C++ nor all of 
\acslpp as defined in its language definition\cite{acslpp}.
The most important such limitations are listed in this section.

\section{Implementation of C++}

\textit{These lists are not (nearly) complete}

The following C++ features are not implemented in \acslpp.
\begin{itemize}
\item preprocessing is restricted within \acslpp annotations (cf. \S\ref{sec:preprocessing})
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation of \acslpp}

These \acslpp features are not yet implemented
\begin{itemize}

\item \fclang cannot process annotations that are separate from the source file
\item \acslpp definitions within template declarations
\item \acslpp specification for standard \cpp library functions are still quite limited
\item ghost declarations
\item model declarations
\item set comprehensions
\item frama-clang info/warn/error messages are not yet properly categorized and integrated with -fclang-log, -fclang-msg-key, fclang-warn-key. In particular, clang messages are completely independent

\end{itemize}

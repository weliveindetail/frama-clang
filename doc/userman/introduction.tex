\chapter{Introduction}

\framac~\cite{userman,fac15} is a modular analysis framework for the C
programming language which supports the \acsl specification
language~\cite{acsl}. This manual documents the \fclang plug-in of \framac,
version \fclangversion. 
The \fclang plug-in supports the \acslpp extension of \acsl for C++ programs and specifications; 
it is built on the Clang\footnote{https://clang.llvm.org/} compiler infrastructure and uses Clang for 
parsing C++. The plug-in extends clang to parse \acslpp, translating it into an intermediate language for C and \acsl.

The \fclang plug-in intends to provide a full translation of C++ and \acslpp into the \framac internal representation, and from there to allow C++ progems and \acslpp specifications to be analyzed by other \framac plug-ins. 
\textit{This is a work in progress.}
The following sections describe the current status and limitations of the current implementation.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The plug-in aims for the C++11 version of C++
	\item \acslpp is described in the companion \acslpp reference manual \cite[TODO], also a part of the \framac release.
\end{itemize}


Notes
\begin{itemize}
	\item Which version of Clang?
	\item Clang (8) support C++98 (except exported templates, later removed) and C++11 and current draft standard for C++1y 
	\item see https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html\#cxx for supported features in clang C++
\end{itemize}

%The \fclang version you are using is indicated by the
%command \texttt{frama-c -e-acsl-version}\optionidx{-}{e-acsl-version}. \fclang
%automatically translates an annotated C program into another program that fails
%at runtime if an annotation is violated. If no annotation is violated, the
%behavior of the new program is exactly the same as the one of the original
%program.


%This manual does \emph{not} explain how to install the \eacsl plug-in.  For
%installation instructions please refer to the \texttt{INSTALL} file in the
%\eacsl distribution. \index{Installation} Furthermore, even though this manual
%provides examples, it is \emph{not} a full comprehensive tutorial on
%\framac or \eacsl.

% You can still refer to any external
% tutorial~\cite{rv13tutorial} for additional examples.
